# Research Projects

## Robot-Assisted Feeding

- 2022 -- present
- Implementing an end-to-end pipeline for robot-assisted feeding, including bite sequencing, food acquisition with a spoon, and transferring food to the user.
- Developing a personalized assistive feeding system that adapts to user preferences and needs, leveraging language corrections to modify robot actions.
- Developing a goal-conditioned scooping policy to scoop a target amount of food while considering different food properties.
- Exploring the integration of foundation models in robotics for more adaptive and intelligent robots.

## Grasping in Clutter

- 2020 -- 2023
- Developed a shared autonomy framework to decide when and what to query users in scenarios where uncertainty is high, enabling more effective human-robot collaboration.
- Developed a point-and-click interface for robotic grasping in cluttered environments by generating better grasp poses through object segmentation.
