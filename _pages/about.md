I am a 4th-year PhD student at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. My research is centered on developing physics-based simulations for human-robot interactions, with a particular focus on assistive and rehabilitative devices. Currently, I am also exploring the integration of foundational models into these simulations to create more intuitive and adaptable interactions between robots and humans.

My research interests encompass a wide range of areas, including human-robot interaction, physics-based simulation, human modeling, machine learning, and reinforcement learning. I am particularly passionate about building realistic digital twins—virtual models that accurately capture users' abilities and disabilities—to enhance the personalization and effectiveness of robotic systems. My ultimate goal is to accelerate the development of robotics that closely interact with humans, utilizing generative and evaluative simulations to make these systems more effective and safe.

Beyond my research, I enjoy a range of creative hobbies. I spend my free time 3D printing, designing 3D models, mountain biking, and engaging in computer gaming. These hobbies allow me to explore different forms of creativity and unwind from my academic pursuits.
